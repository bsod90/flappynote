## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Select your settings**: Choose a root note, musical mode, and direction (ascending/descending)
2. **Click "Start Game"**: Grant microphone access when prompted
3. **Sing to fly**: Your voice controls the musical note's vertical position
4. **Match the pitch**: Sing the correct note to pass through each gate
5. **Complete the scale**: Navigate through all gates to win!

## 🎼 Features

### Musical Modes
- **Scales**: Major, Natural Minor, Harmonic Minor, Melodic Minor, Pentatonic, Blues, Chromatic
- **Modes**: Dorian, Mixolydian
- **Chords**: Major Triad, Minor Triad (arpeggios)
- **Advanced**: Whole Tone, Diminished

### Game Features
- **Real-time pitch detection** using the YIN algorithm
- **Automatic Gain Control (AGC)** - works at any distance from your mic
- **Direction control** - practice ascending or descending scales
- **Visual feedback** - gates light up when you sing correctly
- **Solfège notation** - learn with Do-Re-Mi syllables
- **Multiple octave support** - sing any octave of the target note

## 🛠️ Built With

This entire project was **created using AI** (Claude by Anthropic) - from initial concept to final implementation, including:
- Game logic and physics
- Pitch detection engine
- Visual design and animations
- Musical theory implementation
- Test suite

### Technologies
- **Vite** - Build tool and dev server
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - No frameworks, just pure JS
- **Web Audio API** - Microphone input and audio processing
- **Canvas API** - 2D rendering
- **Pitchfinder** - YIN algorithm for pitch detection
- **Vitest** - Unit testing
- **Playwright** - End-to-end testing

## 🚀 Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm

### Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test

# Run browser tests
npm run test:browser

# Build for production
npm run build
```

### Deployment

To deploy to AWS S3 and CloudFront:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your credentials:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Add your AWS credentials and account ID to `.env`:
   ```
   VITE_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
   AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=your_account_id
   ```

3. Run the deployment script:
   ```bash
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

The script will:
- Verify AWS credentials and account ID
- Build the production bundle
- Deploy to S3
- Invalidate CloudFront cache
